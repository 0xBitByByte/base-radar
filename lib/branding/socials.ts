/**
 * Display metadata for every external link platform `SocialLink` supports.
 * Real brand marks are used where this codebase already has one
 * (`BrandIcons`: GitHub, Discord, X, Linktree); everything else gets a
 * generic, representative icon rather than a fabricated logo — the same
 * choice this codebase already made for Telegram (lucide's `Send`) before
 * this registry existed. Farcaster isn't in PR8A's named platform list but
 * is real, existing project data (`Community.socials.farcaster`) that
 * `QuickViewCommunity` already rendered pre-PR8A — included so that link
 * has a home here too, instead of staying on a separate, un-migrated path.
 * Linktree is Base Radar's own site-wide community link (`constants/site.ts`
 * `SITE.social.linktree`) — not a per-project social field, but the same
 * "one place per platform" principle applies.
 *
 * `hoverClassName` is set only for platforms whose brand color was
 * previously hardcoded independently in both `Sidebar.tsx` and
 * `Footer.tsx` (Discord/Telegram/Linktree) — centralizing it here removes
 * that duplication. GitHub/X intentionally have no `hoverClassName`: each
 * consumer's neutral hover treatment differs slightly by design (Sidebar
 * supports both themes, Footer is dark-only), so unifying them would force
 * an identical treatment onto two legitimately different contexts.
